      Practice your speech out loud several times so you feel confident and natural.
      Use pauses to let important points sink in and don‚Äôt rush through your ideas. Keep your slides clean, 
      using images or charts instead of lots of text. If possible, add a little humor or emotion‚Äîit helps people remember your message.
      Always end with a strong conclusion that summarizes your key points and leaves the audience with something to think about or act on.

        <h2>award ceremony</h2>
        <p>
          The award ceremony for the in-school presentation contest held at the forum last year was held.
          The best student this time was Chilini, a second-year student. Thilini was presented with a certificate of commendation and 3kg of delicious Niigata rice.
          After the award ceremony, <strong>Thilini</strong> presented the presentation materials he had used at the contest to the first-year students.<p>
          The theme was "Japan as I saw it." All materials and explanations were in Japanese. The materials, created using PowerPoint, were very creative and left a lasting impression on the students and staff.
          After the presentations, the first-year students had a chance to ask thilini questions. <p>"How long did it take you to prepare the materials?" "What was difficult about coming to Japan?" "What do you think is important in school life?" and so on, and Chilini answered each and every one of their questions carefully.
          Seeing the reliable example of their senior colleagues must have further increased their motivation.

        <p>Girl Power is a powerful movement that uplifts and celebrates the strength, 
          intelligence, and resilience of girls everywhere. It means having the freedom to speak up,
           to dream big, and to shape your own future. Girls are not limited by the roles society once placed 
           on them‚Äîthey are scientists, artists, leaders, athletes, and visionaries. Girl power is about embracing your uniqueness, 
           overcoming challenges with courage, and proving that being a girl is a symbol of strength, not limitation.
          When girls are empowered through education, equality, and opportunity, they uplift not only themselves but entire communities.
          Girl power also means supporting other girls, standing together in unity,
          and believing in the power of sisterhood. It's a reminder to every girl: you are strong, you are capable, and you can change the world.
        </p>

        <p>Girl Power is about realizing that every
          girl holds a light within her ‚Äî a light of strength,
          passion, and purpose. It‚Äôs the voice that says, ‚ÄúI can,‚Äù even when the world says,
          ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt.‚Äù Girl power encourages girls to rise above fear, break down barriers,
          and chase their dreams with confidence. It‚Äôs about equality, freedom, and the right to be heard and respected.
          Girls are not just the future ‚Äî they are the present, making an impact every single day.
          Whether it's through education, leadership, creativity, or kindness, girl power shines in every brave step a girl takes.
          When girls believe in themselves and support one another, they create unstoppable energy that brings positive change to the world.
           Girl power is not just a phrase ‚Äî it‚Äôs a movement, a mindset, and a force of unstoppable greatness.</p>
